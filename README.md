### **Projects**
- [**LSTMunchies:**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mithunmeenakshis/lstmunchies) Developed a sequential restaurant recommender system using LSTM networks to model and predict personalized food ordering behavior over time. Simulated realistic user order history with preferences like cuisine, budget, and frequency. Incorporated an "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature to promote novelty and reduce decision fatigue, enabling faster and more diverse food choices.
- [**Musk’s Sentiment:**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mithunmeenakshis/musk-s-sentiment) Conducted sentiment analysis on Elon Musk’s tweets using NLP techniques to classify sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral. Applied clustering to identify patterns over time and visualized key trends.
- [**Chennai AQI Prediction:**](https://github.com/mithunmeenakshis/chennai_aqi) Developed an LSTM model to forecast air quality index (AQI) using Chennai's weather and AQI data from 2024. Explored time-series forecasting techniques and visualized model performance through rolling window analysis.
